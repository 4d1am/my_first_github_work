# My_first_github_work
It is my repo to practice various Git commands
This is my first github repository, which stores my automation test codes, using git to talk with github

Basic command line commands, how to use terminal:
cd: change your working directory, cd hw, this command will change your directoy to hw.
pwd: print working directory. this command will print absolute path for the currently directoy you are in if you are not sure where you are. Directoy is a fancy word for folder.
~ shorthand for home directory.
. shorthand for current directory, cd .  this command will change your directory to the current directory. (Aka do nothing)
.. shorthand for parent directory above your current directory, cd .. will change your directoy to its parent. If you are in /workspace/day1/, the command will place you in /workspace/.
ls: list all the files and folders in your current folder. 
mkdir: make a directory, this command will make a new directory within current directory. You can think of a directory as creating another folder on your local computer.
touch: create a new file in the current directory, touch filename.txt
rm: remove the file in the current directory, it will not work if the file doesn't exist.
rm -r [dir]: This command will remove the dir directory recursively. In other words, it will delete all the files and directories in dir in addition to dir itself. Be careful with this command!
cat: display all contents of the file, This command is useful for inspecting the contents of files in the terminal without having to open them in a program. It is not as useful for large files (which can clutter the terminal) or non-text files (which will likely output gibberish).
cp: copy a file, cp lab1/original lab2/duplicate, This command will copy the original file in the lab1 directory and create a duplicate file in the lab2 directory.
mv: move or rename a file, mv lab1/original lab2/original, This command moves original from lab1 to lab2. Unlike cp, mv does not leave original in the lab1 directory.
mv lab1/original lab1/newname, This command does not move the file but rather renames it from original to newname.

My god, I am trying to push it again, hopefully it works
